# Algorithms 101
This is an enormous topic and has been treated many many times over by others online. For that reason this lesson is just a list of resources.  Because algorithms are such a broad and tricky subject, every starts somewhere different and explains it even more differently.  Take a look through all of the resources, discuss together, and find the one that works best for you.  Feel free to let us know if we missed any good ones!

For the specific data structures and algorithms you'll be asked to complete refer the [_Data Structures_](https://github.com/jankeLearning/projects/tree/master/03-data-structures) project, specific resources are in there.

### Study Tips  
When studying a difficult algorithm try these tricks:  
	* Pick a specific, simple input and walk through the algorithm by hand.  
	* Make diagrams of what happens to the argument as the algorithm transforms it.  
	* Ask yourself what types of arguments are easy or difficult for this process to work with.

* [Short article introudction](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/understanding-the-principles-of-algorithm-design--net-26561).  Example-based, quite good.
* [Deeper introduction](http://algorithms.openmymind.net) with entries on several searches and data types, including some we will cover.  Everything outside of what we will cover is more advanced.
* [via sorting and data structures](https://medium.com/@yanganif/tackling-javascript-algorithms-66f1ac9770dc)
* [khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms#asymptotic-notation).  Deeper and longer than NECESSARY for class. but still pretty good
* [many examples and data-structure libraries](http://javascript-html5-tutorial.com/algorithms-and-data-structures-in-javascript.html)
* [CodeMonk](https://www.hackerearth.com/fr/practice/codemonk/).  Brilliant.
